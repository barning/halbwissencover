# Podcast Cover Generator
Cover generator for ["Gef√§hrliches Halbwissen"](https://halbwissen.co/). But is developed for other podcasts in mind.

Creates a JPG file according to the Apple standards for podcast covers.
More features will be added bit by bit, but first my own requirements have to be implemented.

## Development
Your need nvm, npm and node. First type `nvm use`, them `npm install` and then `npm start` in your CLI to start the service locally. For deployment type `npm deploy`.
